## Try out [the online version of Mappertje](https://mappertje.tk/src/#/)

Projection mapping tool for Chrome and Firefox. Apply perspective correction and crop your source (camera or screen) to map it onto a rectangular target surface with corner pinning.

## Download the [browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mappertje/okokapnhegofpbaeogkmbcaflmgiopkg) from the Chrome Web Store

The Mappertje extension integrates directly with my [Pop-out Jitsi Meet](https://github.com/Jip-Hop/jitsi-pop) extension.
